## CAREHUB
The website is aimed at people require care services, and carers who may be searching for the information for them.
The app provides a list of Care Providers, their services information and contact details. Registered users are able to rate their services, and also leave comments on the service they received.
The design is aimed to be simple and easy to navigate. Accessiblity was a major factor in the site design.

## HEADING ONE

ADD TEXT HERE

## Design 

Initially a flow chart was created to work out how the user navigates the site. It shows where the user should input data, how to validate that data, and what happens for a correct or incorrect entry.

## Fixed and Unfixed Bugs

* No known unfixed bugs

## Validation 

ADD TEXT HERE
* When tested the website generally recommended pep8online.com was down. 
    * As a workaround, a PEP8 validator was used in the Gitpod Workspace directly by following these steps:
    * Run the command pip3 install pycodestyle (Note that this extension may already be installed, in which case this command will do nothing.)
    * In my workspace, press Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac).
    * Type the word linter into the search bar that appears, and click on Python: Select Linter from the filtered results.
    * Select pycodestyle from the list.
    * PEP8 errors would be underlined in red, as well as being listed in the PROBLEMS tab beside your terminal.

* Fixed: Extra spaces in code. Comments incorrectly added. Removed extra trailing spaces as hilighted.   

## Testing

* Tested on the local terminal, and tested the deployed site on Google Chrome on a mac and also a laptop

## Project Creation and Deployment

The project was created in Git Hub using the Code Institute template.

The following commands were used throughout the project:
* git add . - This command was used to add files to the staging area before committing.
* git commit -m "I add commit message here" - This command was used to to commit changes to the local repository.
* git push - This command is used to push all committed changes to the GitHub repository.
